# Single-Nucleotide-Polymorphism

## About
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using whole genome sequencing of multiple wheat accessions. The pipeline is designed to handle multiple accessions and large chromosomes, which may need to be split into smaller sub-chromosomes. It is recommended for use on a high-performance computing cluster (HPC-SLURM), though the scripts can be adapted for use on any system.
